When we try to run the command above, we receive the error shown below because there is a mismatch between the table and data schemas.

## What Is schema enforcement?

Schema enforcement, also known as schema validation, is a safeguard in Delta Lake that ensures data quality by rejecting writes to a table that do not match the table’s schema. It checks to see whether each column in data inserted into the table is on its list of expected columns and rejects any writes with columns that aren’t on the list or with data type mismatches.

## Appending files to an existing Delta table with schema evolution

In this case, we would like our table to accept the new schema and add the data to the table.

What Is schema evolution?

Schema evolution is a feature that allows users to easily change a table’s current schema to accommodate data that is changing over time. Most commonly, it’s used when performing an append or overwrite operation, to automatically adapt the schema to include one or more new columns.
